# Anomaly-Detection-in-Web-Application-Logs-Using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on detecting anomalies in web application logs. 
Web applications generate a massive amount of log data, which can be overwhelming to monitor manually. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to automatically identify and flag abnormal log entries, helping to enhance security and performance.

## Features
1.Automatic Anomaly Detection
2.Easy Integration
3.Real-time Monitoring

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Various Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib,Pycaret,Pyod, etc.)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to suggest improvements or report bugs.
